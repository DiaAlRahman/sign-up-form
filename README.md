# iSketch - Sign Up Page

This project is a sign-up form designed to demonstrate raw front-end skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The form serves as the entry point for users to sign up and then redirects them to a login page, allowing access to the iSketch app, which is listed in my project portfolio.

## Features

- **Modern Aesthetics**:
  - Redesigned default form elements with rounded borders and larger fonts for a sleek, modern appearance.
  - Custom styling that eliminates the default browser styles to achieve a consistent look and feel across devices.

- **Navigation**:
  - After successful sign-up, users are redirected to a login page.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Front-End Development
- Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)

## Challenges Overcome

1. **Styling Form Elements**:
   - Form elements are inherently difficult to style due to their default browser-specific styles. Stripping these defaults and creating a cohesive design required meticulous effort.

2. **Responsive Design**:
   - Ensured that the form is fully responsive and visually appealing across various screen sizes.

## How to Run the Sign-Up Page

1. **Fork the Repository**:
   - Visit the repository on GitHub and click on the "Fork" button to create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Clone the forked repository to your local machine using the command:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
     ```

3. **Install Live Server Extension**:
   - Install the [Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) for your code editor (e.g., VS Code).

4. **Run the Server**:
   - Open the project folder in your code editor.
   - Right-click on the `index.html` file.
   - Select the "Open with Live Server" option or use the shortcut `Alt+L, Alt+O` to start the live server.

5. **Test the Functionality**:
   - Fill out the sign-up form to experience the interface.
   - Submit the form to verify the redirection to the login page.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Modernizing Legacy Elements**:
   - Learned how to work with old HTML elements and enhance their appearance using modern design principles.

2. **Seamless Navigation**:
   - Implemented redirection logic to guide users smoothly from sign-up to login.

3. **User Experience**:
   - Understood the importance of making forms user-friendly and visually appealing to ensure a positive first impression.
